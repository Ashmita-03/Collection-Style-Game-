🗑️ Trash Catcher Game
🎮 Overview

Trash Catcher Game is a fun and simple arcade-style game built with p5.js and p5.play.
The goal is to move the catcher (a dustbin) using the arrow keys to catch falling trash objects. Each successful catch increases your score, while missing one decreases it.

This game was designed to encourage recycling awareness in a light, interactive way—showing that every piece of trash caught (or missed) makes a difference! 🌍♻️

🕹️ How to Play

Use the Left Arrow ← and Right Arrow → keys to move the catcher across the screen.

Catch falling objects to earn points.

✅ Catch trash = +1 point

❌ Miss trash = -1 point

Don’t let objects fall to the bottom of the screen—your score will drop!

Keep playing to achieve the highest score possible.
