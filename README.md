# 🗑️ Trash Catcher Game

## 🎮 Overview

Trash Catcher Game is this straightforward arcade thing made with p5.js and p5.play. You basically move around a dustbin catcher using the arrow keys, trying to snag all these falling trash items. Grab one right, and your score goes up by a point. Miss it, and you lose one. 

The whole idea behind it was to get people thinking about recycling, you know, in a chill, hands-on sort of way. Like, every bit of trash you catch or let slip away really adds up to something bigger for the planet. 

## 🕹️ How to Play

You hit the left arrow key to slide the catcher that way, or the right one to go the other direction across the bottom of the screen. 

Then there are these objects dropping down from the top, and your job is to catch them all. 

Catching trash gets you plus one point, easy enough. But if you miss, it dings you minus one, which sucks a bit. 

Just make sure nothing hits the bottom without getting caught, because that tanks your score quick. Keep at it as long as you can, chasing that top score. 

## 🌟Features

It has these basic arrow key controls that feel pretty intuitive right off the bat. 

The trash falls at random speeds and spots each time, so replaying never gets old or predictable. 

There's a scoring setup to keep track of how you're doing, nothing fancy but it works. 

And yeah, it ties into this environmental recycling vibe, which is kind of the point. 

## 🚀Future Improvements

We could throw in different kinds of trash, like plastic bottles or cans and paper scraps, to mix things up. 

Maybe add some bonus recyclables that give extra points when you nab them. 

A timer or level system would ramp up the challenge over time. 

Oh and background tunes plus sound effects could make it way more engaging.
