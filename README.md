# Trash Collector Game
### Overview 
This game collects the trash that is being dropped at randomized speeds. This is to educate the audience to not litter waste and to follow the 3R's- reuse, reduse and recycling, and keep our environment green and clean. I made this game using p5.play and p5.js, for my summer camp.

### Features
- Randomized speeds of the trashbag being dropped
- Can move the dustbin with left and right arrow keys.
- Adds one point if you catch one trashbag.
- Takes off one point if u fail to catch one trashbag.
- Text explanation on how to move the dustbin.

### Technologies used
-p5.js
-p5.play

### Struggles and Learnings
I struggled to randomized the speed of the trashbag. I learnt how the randomization works, and I learnt how an assest can be classified in 3 modes, that affects the catching and changing scores.
